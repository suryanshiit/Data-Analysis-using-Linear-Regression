# Data-Analysis-using-Linear-Regression

· Overview: Implemented linear regression to create resistance and support trendlines for Financial Time Series Data

· Utilized linear regression to generate regression lines, identifying pivot points using accuracy-based approach

· Developed resistance and support trendlines parallel to the best-fit regression line with y intercept as variable parameter

· Implemented binary search to calculate y-intercepts, ensuring no intersection of trend lines with the candlestick data

· Developed Epsilon parameter, to define permissible wick intersections, enhancing the precision of the analysis
